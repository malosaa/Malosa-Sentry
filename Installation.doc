Malosa Sentry - A real-time status plugin for homeseer trough NodeJS.


Sorry guys i don't had the time to write a full manual so i do it this way.
https://github.com/malosaa/Malosa-Sentry is the repo but the code is protected, as i have put a license on it.
This version is a trial with full functionality, new special add-ons will not be updated in this trial version.

The only limitation is that it will close after 1 hour of use, and u can restart it as many times as u want.
and sometimes it will send a message in the channel saying its a trial.
U can use this program on any pc, doesn't need to be on the same pc of homeseer, as long as its in the same network.

****************************************FIRST**************************************************************************

What you need to do first,
Go to discord.com and register an account.

https://www.iorad.com/player/1633572/create-bot#trysteps-1   (if it doesn't fit in your screen click on the magnifying glass right left side below in the screen.
u can choose various versions (interactive,a step to step with pictures, or video) 
To invite your bot to your channel use this link : https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(YOURBOTID)&scope=bot  change yourbotid to your bot token without the ()


****************************************THE CONFIGS**************************************************************************
Well, if u done everything correct, u have a server and some channels.
now we setup the .vbs file in the root directory and the kill.bat and malosa-sentry.bat in Etra files folder, just open them in a text editor.
if you done we need to setup the config.json in the /config folder 


bot_secret_token = the discord bot secret token.
Product_ID = serial code for license of this program (not needed now)
Homeseer_ip = ip of homeseer
Homeseer_port = port
Homeseer_ASCI_Port = your homeseer ASCII port
OwnerID = your discord owner id (u can get that by right click your name and click copy id)
StatusCHannelID = the channel u want to use for all live status, u can get the id the same way as you did with owner id.
Channel2Way = this is the channel u want to use for 2 way communication, right click on the selected channel and copy id 
GuildID = the id of your discord server. (right click on your server icon the ROUND one left side and select copy id)
all the groups under this works the same way as above.

Role1-5 = that are the roles u created, only add here the roles of people (and yourself) that can send commands or ask status from homeseer trough discord.

replacements = not ready yet, this will replace custom text received by devices or status.

Priority group = put false for off and true for on, if "on" the bot will DM u.

Priority devices = if u put the refid and enable (priority group) if a status change, in homeseer it will direct message you instead of a message in a separate channel.

All the other things like LIGHTS-TEMPERATURE-PIR-WINDOW-LEAKSENSOR-DOORS-VENTILATION-SHELLYUPDATES, they are preconfigured, i will add more devices later.
never change the names of the group name, this can crash the plug-in. 
U can add as much as ref id's you want, it's unlimited!



ADDONS.json 

That is still in development, its an add-on for all my scripts i released in the past.
Most of the script are Dutch.

Pushbullet.JSON

There you can put all the information of pushbullet
i did integrate pushbullet into this plug-in.
You can use pushbullet to trigger also events or whatever, by creating a virtual device in homeseer, and fill in the PUSHBULLET.json.
When u get a message it will put the output in the homeseer virtual and u can trigger from it.

****************************************DEPENCIES**************************************************************************
if you done all the steps, we gonna install the depencies with this command: node install 
BE SURE U HAVE A RECENT WINDOWS SDK INSTALLED AND MOST OF THE FRAMEWORKS !!
I have visual studio 2019 installed + C++ desktop environment, its all selectable during the installation of VS19.
More info on the github page.

if everything is installed use this command to start the plugin: (node malosa-sentry) this is the normal window, if ?RESET is used in discord it will restart the plugin in a new window named MALOSA-SENTRY, and u can clore this one.
I did test it on windows 7+8+10 x64+x86 all work correct.
*****************************************EXTRA INFO*************************************************************************

Commands u can use for now are:
?RESET  (this will only work if u have setup the roles correctly, it will restart malosa-sentry in a new window with the vb script)

Soon to be added:
!where is my car
!is homeseer ok ? (returns with stats of homeseer, costomizable by json config)
!where is ***** ? ( request a location +map of a person, works only if u are the owner or have the specific role)
and much much more.



****************************************WARNING!!**************************************************************************
WARNING!
Never ever make your bot public to other people or give someone the bot invite link.
If u do that people can see all your stats from homeseer, but not be able to control them.
Discord is very safe, only use it for people u trust, there is no way people can just random join your server without an invite.
The bot you create works only with your own private key and no one can access it or read it.
